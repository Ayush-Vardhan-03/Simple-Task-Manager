1. How long did you spend on the coding test? 
=> 12 hours

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
=> I didn't used any latest feature.

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
=> I will use logging everywhere and analyze logs for any delayed or repeated logs or errors.
    Analyze code from where delay is happening and Check CPU usage.
    No, I have never had to do this yet.

4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
=> If I had more time, I would add a feature of :-
    "sort by" -> which will sort the tasks according to their 'status', 'due date' and by default 'recently added'.
    "drag and drop" -> through which I can drag the upcoming task and drop it in completed task section so that it become completed. And also can delete it thorugh dropping.
    "login/signup" -> to save the tasks and accessible on any device.
    "time" -> to be able to decide the time also, at which hour task should be done or finished.
    "notification" -> to get notified if task due date or due time is near.
